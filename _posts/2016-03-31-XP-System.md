# XP System

Zacharski sets up an Experience Point system for his grades. The more points you get, the higher your letter grade becomes. In the beginning, everyone starts at F but as the class goes on the letter grades and levels go up. It is designed so that the effort that you put into the class is what you get as a grade at the end of the semester. I love this system while other students don't.
