PostgreSQL - Better than MySQL (at least to me)

# PostgreSQL

One thing I am greatful for from CPSC350 is learning about PostgreSQL. I see many posts on /r/programming about new PostgreSQL modules and addons. It seems that more and more companies are adopting PostgreSQL, which I find odd. I find that there is usually more documentation for MySQL rather than PostgreSQL, but I know implementing MySQL is a bit harder when you aren't using Apache and PHP.

## My Opinion - PostgreSQL vs. MySQL
I used MySQL at an internship during the Summer of 2015. It was nice that I was able to use a graphical interface for MySQL (using MySQL Workshop), but I had learned to hate MySQL on a terminal due to commands being whole words. I know I sound picky with that but when you get adjusted to Bash, you learn to appreciate commands and applications that only take 3 letters to type versus a 7 letter word. PostgreSQL fixes this issue by having shorter commands compared to MySQL.

Versus
``` SQL
