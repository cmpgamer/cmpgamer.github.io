Why? Because it is necessary!

# Why do I bother talking about this?

I bother talking about this because I want more people to understand the type of classroom enviroment that needs to be promoted. Currently, there have not been any other Computer Science courses that I have been in that I can say that I remember 90% of the material besides the ones that I have taken with Zacharski. So I took the time to talk about this type of environment for learning because I think it is beneficial.

# Where is this blog heading?

Now that I have finished talking about the structure and the environment that I had for CPSC350, I can focus more on things that I have learned and what I have found cool in the class. They won't be as dry as the past few posts but like I said, I feel like it was necessary to talk about the learning environment that Zacharski has for his classes.
