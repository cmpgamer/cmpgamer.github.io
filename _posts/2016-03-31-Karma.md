Karma - Help others to help yourself

# Karma

Something that Zacharski rewards that no other professor does is when students help each other to better themselves in a class. I am not talking about giving someone code and letting them steal it, but I am talking about how students help other students understand concepts better without the professor having to get involved.

When Zacharski notices students who help others frequently, he gives out Karma XP. This fluxuates based on how often help is given to other students. In all of Zacharski's classes, he uses Piazza. Piazza is an only open forum only for students in the class that Zacharski is teaching. Piazza can be used to give general notes, ask questions, or even show code (not in the bad way).

It is nice that when a professor notices that you help a lot of students that you get rewarded for that type of behavior.
