#Rudiments

In order for the class to keep on track and have students learning new things with each project, Zacharski implemented a Rudiment system. Rudiments are small projects that focus on one small task that students need to complete in order to gain XP and learn something useful. The good thing about rudiments is that they are small projects that, to me, have not taken too long to complete.

##The Good

The good thing about rudiments is that students will remember what they have done in the rudiments because they had to spent more than an hour on each rudiment. The rudiments also aim to teach students new concepts and technologies that traditional Computer Science courses won't go over or don't reward students that go above and beyond.

##The Bad

The bad thing about rudiments is that on average, rudiments should be completed in 10 hours or less. I have not had a problem with this "time constraint" as some would say, but average students could easily spent more than 10 or 15 hours on a single rudiment because they have to learn new material.

##The Redemption

The redeeming quality of Rudiments is that they force the student to research on their own. This encourages good behavior because at a real job, you are encouraged to Google and research new technologies and ways to solve problems. Many people in the class don't see this because they believe in a strict, rigid structure for college and not a way to better prepare students for the future.
