### About CPSC350 - Applications of Databases

So eventually with the Computer Science major at the University of Mary Washington, every student has to take CPSC350 Applications of Databases. This is a misnomer for many students because they think that this is a pure databases class. It is not. It is applying databases to skeleton code with modification or writing a web application from scratch.

The class is taught by Ron Zacharski. He wants the students to understand and remember the material because he know it will be useful for the future of all students who go though the class. Now I might be a bit more biased because I have helped Zacharski with his CPSC110H Intro to Computer Science and I have taken CPSC419 Data Mining with Zacharski. He really knows what he is talking about when compared to others. He wants all of his students to be successful rather than fail.

So that brings me to the topic about this post: "About CPSC350". Like I mentioned before, this class requires that students apply databases to web applications, whether if the assignment is skeleton code or if it has to be a web application built from the ground up. The class is broken up into teams based on how much experience a person has in a certain field. Since I knew Python and SQL well, I was one of the first picks for a team. In the first half of the semester, we ended up taking 4 RATs (Quizzes/Tests that Zacharski calls "Readiness Assessment Tests") and there were 3 Lightning rounds (Which are quick paced team activities to convert English to SQL queries). This half of the semester is based on SQL, ending with a SQL project that has 3 Sprints (formatted with Scrum). The second half of the semester is learning about different NoSQL databases like Cassandra and MongoDB.
