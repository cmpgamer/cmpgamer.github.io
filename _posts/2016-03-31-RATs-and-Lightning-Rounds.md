RATs and Lightning Rounds - Learn the material and learn to remember the material

# RATs
RATs seem to be an issue with many students because they have never thought of a quiz or test like how a RAT is structured. The first part of a RAT is an individual test and you can put 5 points spread across 5 answers. If you know answer A is correct, you'd put 5 points, but if you are unsure if C or E is correct, you can split the 5 points into 3 and 2. And if you really don't know the answer, you can put 1 point on each of the 5 answers. Personally I love RATs for this.

The second half of the RATs is taking the same individual test over with your team, but now you are handed a scratch off sheet. This sheet has 5 scratable areas for each of the 5 answer choices. There is a little star that you can uncover when you scratch the sheet and that shows that the answer is correct. If you don't get it right on the first try, the possible ammount of points from 5 goes down, each time until it is 1 point on the 4th scratch.

# Lightning Rounds
Lightning Rounds are the fun portion of the class, if you have a good team. I found these more to be experience gainers if people in your group were ahead and not stuck behind. Case in point with the last Lightning Round. My team was able to get 135 XP while another team in the other section of the class only got 25 XP. It's not a fair part of the class because if your team sucks, then you suffer. Luckily my team did not suck. If you have a good team, you will learn a lot about going from English sentences to SQL queries.
